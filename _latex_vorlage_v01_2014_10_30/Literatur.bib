@inproceedings{L.Wang.2019,
 abstract = {In order to achieve an intuitive interaction and visual semantic navigation for the indoor robot, we propose a novel object-aware hybrid map. The existing map is usually a metric map, lacking semantics for interaction. We combine objects in the indoor environment with the metric map to constitute a hybrid map. The map consists of a 3D object semantic map and a 2D occupancy grid map, which transfers human commands to the grid map through object semantics, thereby enabling autonomous navigation for the robot. We utilize ORB-SLAM2 for continuous pose estimation and 3D mapping. 2D object detection in key-frames is conducted based on YOLO v3. The object point clouds in multiple perspectives are merged and a 3D bounding box of the object is estimated. These objects construct a 3D semantic map. Furthermore, we project a 3D point cloud map into a 2D plane in order to get an occupancy grid map. Finally, these two maps are combined forming an object-aware hybrid map. We conduct experiments in real environments in order to verify the feasibility and robustness of the hybrid map for robot semantic navigation.},

@article{Mohammed.2020,
 abstract = {Perception is a vital part of driving. Every year, the loss in visibility due to snow, fog, and rain causes serious accidents worldwide. Therefore, it is important to be aware of the impact of weather conditions on perception performance while driving on highways and urban traffic in all weather conditions. The goal of this paper is to provide a survey of sensing technologies used to detect the surrounding environment and obstacles during driving maneuvers in different weather conditions. Firstly, some important historical milestones are presented. Secondly, the state-of-the-art automated driving applications (adaptive cruise control, pedestrian collision avoidance, etc.) are introduced with a focus on all-weather activity. Thirdly, the most involved sensor technologies (radar, lidar, ultrasonic, camera, and far-infrared) employed by automated driving applications are studied. Furthermore, the difference between the current and expected states of performance is determined by the use of spider charts. As a result, a fusion perspective is proposed that can fill gaps and increase the robustness of the perception system.},

@article{Thrun.2003,
 abstract = {This article describes a new algorithm for acquiring occupancy grid maps with mobile robots. Existing occupancy grid mapping algorithms decompose the high-dimensional mapping problem into a collection of one-dimensional problems, where the occupancy of each grid cell is estimated independently. This induces conflicts that may lead to inconsistent maps, even for noise-free sensors. This article shows how to solve the mapping problem in the original, high-dimensional space, thereby maintaining all dependencies between neighboring cells. As a result, maps generated by our approach are often more accurate than those generated using traditional techniques. Our approach relies on a statistical formulation of the mapping problem using forward models. It employs the expectation maximization algorithm for searching maps that maximize the likelihood of the sensor measurements.},
